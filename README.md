# Roni's Mac Bar Sales Dashboard

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the desire to help a local business, **Roniâ€™s Mac Bar**, gain deeper insights into its operations. By analyzing their sales data, we aimed to provide actionable insights that could help optimize menu offerings, streamline operations, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction. The challenge of transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations was an exciting opportunity to showcase how data can drive real-world business decisions.

## What It Does
The dashboard provides a **comprehensive overview** of Roni's Mac Bar's sales performance. It tracks key metrics such as:

- **Total orders** by month and year
- **Distribution of orders** by menu items and modifiers (e.g., cheddar, brisket)
- **Hourly distribution of orders** to identify peak times
- **A word cloud** showing the frequency of modifier requests

This dashboard enables Roniâ€™s team to quickly assess **sales trends, popular menu items, and customer preferences**, helping them make data-driven decisions.

## How We Built It
We built the dashboard using **Power BI**, which allowed us to seamlessly integrate multiple datasets and create interactive visualizations. The process involved:

### ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning
- Used **Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas** to clean and normalize sales data for consistency and accuracy.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis
- Explored trends and patterns, focusing on **order volume by month, popular modifiers, and time-based trends**.

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Design
- Used **Power BI visualization tools** to create various charts (**bar charts, pie charts, line graphs**) and a **word cloud** to represent insights intuitively.

### ðŸ”¹ Interactivity
- Added **filters** to allow users to drill down into **specific time periods or menu categories**.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Handling **incomplete or inconsistent data**, as some months had missing entries or irregularities in how modifiers were recorded.
- Ensuring that the dashboard remained **informative yet not overwhelming** to the user.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Creating a **user-friendly dashboard** that provides clear insights into **customer preferences and operational efficiency**.
- Successfully integrating multiple visual elements, like the **word cloud and modifier breakdown**, to offer **quick sales insights**.
- Ensuring **scalability**, so new data can be added easily without requiring significant rework.

## What We Learned
- **Data cleaning and preparation** are crucial for building effective dashboards.
- **Designing visualizations** that are both informative and easy to interpret for non-technical users is key.
- **Power BI** enables the creation of powerful **interactive dashboards** that present complex datasets in an accessible format.

## What's Next for Roni's Challenge
ðŸ”® **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting **future sales trends** based on historical data to help with peak season and slow period preparations.

ðŸ‘¥ **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying different types of customers based on their order patterns to optimize menu offerings and marketing strategies.

ðŸ“Š **Real-time Data**: Implementing a **real-time order count** for daily/weekly sales tracking (**prototype section included in the dashboard**).
